# Group our ShoppingList

### Eric Enaburekhan Ruby on Rails Capstone project

> Group our ShoppingList is a web application with a responsive behavior for mobile usage built with Ruby on Rails. This mobile web application is use for grouping payments by a goal with your family/friends. You can find the full requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Group-our-transactions-ccea2b6642664540a70de9f30bdff4ce). Inspecting this project, you can find the following options (login, sign-in, all my shopping_list, all my external shopping_list, all groups, log out and a checkout a shopping_list as an additional feature).
One is required to sign-up/sign-in before you can start using the application. Group our ShoppingList is similar to an online store where you purchase items grouped into a category called shopping cart while the list of items grouped into the category of I will save and review later are referred to as shopping list. Thus, Group our ShoppingList app allows you to group and save a list of items to review and purchase on a later date.
If you don't want your item/product to be associated with any category, you can create a shopping list that will not be associated with any group or category. The checkout is an extra feature I added so one can be able to proceed with the check out for any of the items you saved.
